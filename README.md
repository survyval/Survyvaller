# Survyvaller
Official plugin for the Survyval server.

## Notice
This is a server support plugin. Beware of personal style and half-coded / sloppy features.
I just put it on github for my ease of use and transperancy.
Feel free to report bugs and / or suggestions, _but I will not provide support._
Feel free to use parts of this plugin, _but keep to the license!_
